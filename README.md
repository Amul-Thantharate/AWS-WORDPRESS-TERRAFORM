## Wordpress Deployment on AWS using Terraform 

# Introduction
In todayâ€™s digital landscape, having a reliable and scalable infrastructure is paramount for running web applications like WordPress. In this tutorial, we will deploy a WordPress application on AWS using Terraform. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. Terraform manages external resources with providers, which are plugins that translate the API interactions with the service. Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
